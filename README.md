# Pickleball-App 
This app is designed for me and my friends who play pickleball once in a while. We often get into debates about who ranks higher or who has more wins. To settle these discussions, I created this app to track our matches, record the results, and provide an accurate ranking system. Now, we'll have a clear record of our games and a definitive answer to who the top player is!
